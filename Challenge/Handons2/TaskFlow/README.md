Ensure copilot understands your request before proceeding

üë§ Prompt:

```
I‚Äôm building a web application called¬†**TaskFlow**¬†is being developed for task management in work teams. The application will allow users to create projects, assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress. Users will be able to collaborate, attach files, and communicate through comments on each task. Additionally, the application must have a notification system and user role management.

Before generate any content please Let me know if you understand the context of my app and then I will write you new prompts
```

ü§ñ Copilot Answer:

```
Yes, I understand the context of your application, TaskFlow. It is a web application designed for task management in work teams, allowing users to create projects, assign tasks, set deadlines, track progress, collaborate, attach files, and communicate through comments. It also includes a notification system and user role management.

Please provide the specific details for each section of the SRS document, and I will help you generate the content accordingly.
```

## Step 2: Create Project Structure

üë§ Prompt:

```
@workspace¬†/new¬†now that you have the context, generate an project structure named¬†`docs`¬†and create a folder by each point of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Introduction, Overall Description, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, External Interfaces and Assumptions and Dependencies
```

ü§ñ Copilot Answer:

![alt text](./assets/image.png)

## Step 3: Creating the Introduction

Tell to copilot to help you generate the introduction.

üë§ Prompt:

```
@workspace¬†Good job! now we can continue generating the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document about the taskflow app. Lets start with the Introduction section, please create a markdown file named¬†`Introduction`
```

ü§ñCopilot Answer:

```markdown
# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Taskflow app. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, overall description, external interfaces, and assumptions and dependencies of the Taskflow app.

## Scope

The Taskflow app is a task management application designed to help users organize and prioritize their tasks efficiently. The app will provide features such as task creation, categorization, prioritization, and reminders.

## Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **Task**: A piece of work to be done or undertaken.
- **User**: An individual who uses the Taskflow app.
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification.

## References

- [IEEE Std 830-1998](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/720574): IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.

## Overview

This document is structured as follows:

- **Overall Description**: Provides a high-level overview of the Taskflow app, including its context and major functions.

- **Functional Requirements**: Details the specific functionalities that the Taskflow app must provide.

- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Specifies the performance, usability, reliability, and other non-functional attributes of the Taskflow app.

- **External Interfaces**: Describes the interfaces between the Taskflow app and other systems or components.

- **Assumptions and Dependencies**: Lists the assumptions and dependencies that affect the requirements and development of the Taskflow app.
```

## Step 4: Generate Overall Description Section

At this point, we can ask to copilot for the main users of the system/app, this information we are going to need it in this step.

üë§Prompt:

```
@workspace¬†what are the main users of this taskflow app
```

Copilot should answer something like this :

```
The main users of the Taskflow app can be categorized as follows:

1. **Individual Users**: People who use the app to manage their personal tasks and to-do lists.
2. **Team Members**: Individuals who use the app to collaborate on tasks and projects within a team.
3. **Project Managers**: Users who oversee multiple tasks and projects, assign tasks to team members, and track progress.
4. **Administrators**: Users who manage user accounts, permissions, and overall app settings.

These user roles can help in defining specific requirements and functionalities tailored to each type of user.
```

Now, we can tell to copilot to generate the next section of our document: **Overall Description**

üë§Prompt:

```
@workspace¬†now please generate the next section of our document¬†`Overall Description`¬†specifying Product Perspective, Product Functions, User classes and charateristics, Constraints
```

ü§ñCopilot Answer:

```
